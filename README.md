# Quick Example Project
#### This is a how you can create a markdown file

You can find a cheatsheet to README.md files [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Please create a README file in your project to explain who did what with a little bit of background on your project.

## Bootstrap Icons

I have also added two quick examples of Bootstrap Icons. The CDN for the icons can be found [here](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/#install)

To add an icon to your HTML, it is as simple as adding the CDN link and then creating `<i>` elements:
```html
<i class="bi bi-scooter"></i>
```
